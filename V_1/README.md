Configuration üõ†Ô∏è
-----------------

Before you start using the extension, you need to make two important changes in the `background.js` file to ensure the application works correctly:

### Change 1: OpenAI API Key

1.  Open the `background.js` file located in the `V_1` folder.
    
2.  Navigate to line 49 and replace the placeholder OpenAI API key with your own.
    
    javascriptCopy code
    
    `const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-openai-api-key-here';`
    
    Ensure you have an API key from OpenAI. If you don't, you can obtain one by signing up at [OpenAI's platform](https://openai.com/).
    

### Change 2: Phi2 Endpoint

1.  In the same `background.js` file, find line 20.
    
2.  Change the instance endpoint to match your setup if you're not using the localhost with port 1234.
    
    javascriptCopy code
    
    `const PHI2_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:1234' // Or your custom endpoint`
    
    This step is crucial if your Text-to-Image Phi2 service is running on a different server or port.
